# Overview
--------
This dataset is related to the following publication:

- Hermes D, Wu H, Kerr AB, Wandell BA (2022). Measuring brain beats: cardiac-aligned fast fMRI signals. bioRxiv 2022.02.18.480957; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.18.480957

The data consist of five subjects where we acquired Simultaneous MultiSlice (SMS) fMRI measurements to map brain wide cardiac-gated fMRI signal variations. Whole-brain fMRI data were acquired using several gradient echo EPI sequences with whole brain coverage. An SMS sequence was used with 4mm isotropic voxels, a flip angle of 48 degrees, TR = 250ms, TE = 11.6ms, FOV = 224x224 and 40 slices with multiband factor 8. This resulted in a slice acquisition time of 50 ms. A total of 878 volumes were acquired within a total scan duration of 220 sec. 

### Runs
For sub-3_ses-1, sub-4_ses-1, sub-5_ses-1, and sub-1_ses-2, there is a second run. In the second run, the acquisition direction was reversed to ensure that the slice acquisition order did not drive the results.

### Sessions
In subject 1 data were acquired during 2 separate sessions, the second session was ~3 years after the first session.

### Derivatives
Derivatives are provided to reproduce all figures related to the manuscript:

- brainbeats: output from the brainbeats code, including coregistration and resliced segmentations, necessary to reproduce the figures

- figures: figures used in the manuscript, generated by brainbeats code

- freesurfer: DKT atlas generated by freesurfer, other files removed

- mni: mni surfaces necessary to make the group plots

- surfaces: individual subject cortex renderings in native space, necessary to make figures 6 and 7
 
- rs_fmri: In five additional subjects we share derivatives (rs_fmri) where we analyzed data from a typical resting state fMRI study (Hack et al. 2021) where PPG signals were acquired. A whole brain EPI sequence was used with 3mm isotropic voxels, a flip angle of 77 degrees, TR = 2s, TE = 27.5ms, FOV = 216x216 and 45 slices. A total of 240 volumes were acquired within a total scan duration of 480 sec. 

### Deidentification
T1 weighted images were de-identified using code developed by Christopher G. Schwarz et al., references are https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119357 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117845, code: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mri_reface
